# sdsanalysis

**SDS** (*Systematic and digital documentation of stone artefacts*) [1] is a recording system for stone artefacts. It was created as an uniform coding and standardized listing system of the conventional attributes recorded at lithic inventories to enable well structured, quantitative and comparative analysis. The variable collection in SDS was compiled from several established documentation systems [2]-[7].
